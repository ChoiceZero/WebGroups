# Release beta-v1

This is a program to store groups of websites and to visualize them. 
Either for a student, worker or personal user, it is a convenient way to replace bookmars on browsers by storing them locally in esay to use groups. No need to struggle searching in the confusing bookmark tabs of, for example, Chrome.
It can even store youtube playlists and videos!
> [!NOTE]

### Local files
Because the webs and groups are stored separately (in the *webs_data.json* file), they can be backuped, imported, exported, copied...
> [!Tip]
>To import them to another pc with the program, at the moment you have to replace the *webs_data.json* file with the same one form the other device.

> [!Warning]
>### PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY CONTRIBUTING.
>I made this software free and open source (FOSS). 
>I would highly appreciate other fellow coders adding new functionality to make the program even better to use!
